This problem tests the `WriteScoreR` package.

First, you must load the package:
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
require(WriteScoreR)
```
Generally you will want to do this with an `include=FALSE` directive.

Next, give a unique ID to the set of items.
```{r}
newScorerSet("test1-v0.1")
```

Now you can ask your questions:

You may find it easier to define the items in one place and use them in another:
```{r}
spainrain = choiceItem(Algeria=list(pts=0,hint="Wrong continent"),
                       Spain=list(pts=2,reward="My Fair Lady!"))
hurricanes= choiceItem(often=list(pts=0),usually="no","hardly ever"="yes")
```

* The rain in BLANK falls mainly on the plain. `r I(spainrain)`
* In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes BLANK happen: `r I(hurricanes)`
