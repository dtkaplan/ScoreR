#' Submitting answers to exercises and problems
#' 
#' ScoreR provides functions that insert markup in documents
#' so that the documents become interactive.  The documents are displayed
#' by a server (written in \code{\link{shiny}}) which stores submissions, displays 
#' previous submissions, and enables the submissions to be scored.
#' Each document is called a "problem."  Problems can consist of one or more "questions".
