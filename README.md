ScoreR
======

A shiny app and related R package for online submission of homeworks.

After installing the `devtools` package in the normal way, you can install the `ScoreR` package with:

```
require(devtools)
install_url("http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/ScoreR/ScoreR_0.2.tar.gz")
```

The server software itself is in the `inst/ScoreR-server/` directory.  Copy those files over to an 
application directory on a shiny server.
