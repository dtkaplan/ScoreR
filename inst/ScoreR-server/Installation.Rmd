Installing the ScoreR server
===============================

1. Copy over the .R files in `inst/ScoreR-server` to an application directory on a shiny server.
2. Copy over the files `passwords.csv`, `problemSets.csv`, `IntroBanner.Rmd` into the same directory as (1).
3. Edit the `passwords.csv` file to create accounts.
3. Open up the app (using the URL to your shiny server app).  You should be able to see the instructions for using the system as the first two "assignments"
3. Delete the entries from `problemSets.csv` --- these are just to let you see how things are working.
7. Edit the LINKS TO THE Google Doc files.
