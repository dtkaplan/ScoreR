Installing the ScoreR server
===============================

1. Copy over the .R files in `inst/ScoreR-server` to an application directory on a shiny server.
2. Create a Google spreadsheet with the problem listing and passwords.  Here's [an example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dG00aEtrZWFBU0Z5bDhsU1hETVI2N3c&usp=sharing). You can copy this file on Google and rename it as you like.  
2. If you're using Google spreadsheets, "Publish" the spreadsheet as a CSV file and copy over the obscure link into the SharedAmongSessions.R file. Alternatively, you can replace the `fetchGoogle()` with `read.csv()` if you have your own web repository where you want to keep the problem listing and password file.
2. Copy over `IntroBanner.Rmd` into the same directory as (1).
3. Edit the `passwords.csv` file to create accounts.
3. Open up the app (using the URL to your shiny server app).  You should be able to see the instructions for using the system as the first two "assignments"
