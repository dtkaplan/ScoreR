Welcome to ScoreR
=======================

Typically, an instructor will customize this page for his or her course, perhaps posting information about deadlines, availability of answers, etc.

**ScoreR** is a system for posting problem sets, questions, quizzes, etc. that allows answers to be collected easily.  For multiple-choice type questions, the answers can be graded automatically.

The problems can be written in R-Markdown.
